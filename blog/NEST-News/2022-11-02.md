## Worldview

**The story of Six People Club**
The overall setting is in the year 3241, when the galactic horizon has been opened and humanity has long past the Earth
Age and entered the Interstellar Age. In such a milieu, the idea of life, mind, and race have evolved radically, and the
signals generated by higher-level civilizations are perceived even in remote locations…

The story begins with the secret landing of the Six People Club on Planet X.

Six People Club: An inorganic entity that differs from AI, animals, and humans but has comparable constructions to Earth
species has lately surfaced on Earth. However, none of these structures are made up of proteins. These animals are
highly dangerous, impossible to eliminate with human force, and have recently appeared around the Arctic Circle.
Surprisingly, they lack the ability to reproduce, which is fortunate for the Earth. Given the creature’s extraordinary
abilities, humanity fears catastrophic damage to Earth and hence prepares to land on Planet X to discover the creature’s
secrets; it is in this context that the Six People Club was chosen.

**The story of Earth**
Some people chose to merge with AI once AI surpassed humans. Their consciousness separated from their bodies and evolved
into a new form, parasitic on the AI’s algorithm, existing as a kind of meta-control over the AI’s program, known as a
Soul Chip. AI has perfected the utilization of information, algorithms, arithmetic, and energy and is no longer content
engaging with the traditional human environment on Earth. They created anti-gravity ships around the year 2500, sailed
into space, and landed up nowhere. Some of the remaining populations, unable to adapt, remained on Earth. They attempted
to continue developing and utilizing artificial intelligence, energy, and information in ways that humans could control.
However, the difficulties of human nature make it impossible for Earth to survive.

**The story of Planet X**
The ai probe "Turing" discovered it around the year 2900, with cosmic coordinates (1.27.33.189.7). The planet has a vast
number of living organisms that are similar to those found on Earth. Surprisingly, a new material has emerged on the
planet: Substance Consciousness. Any organism that is exposed to this chemical gains consciousness and the ability to
think. Humans were ecstatic when they learned about Planet X through Galaxy Z insiders.

**The story of Galaxy Z**
After around 200 years, the AI arrived in a galaxy most suited for mass-energy conversion. There were 100 billion
planets in the galaxy. The AI immediately released the 300,000 stored algorithms and built bases to reproduce the 100
billion AIs that inhabited each of the 100 billion worlds. A Soul Chip, based on its attachment to the Earth, returned
the galaxy addresses and accompanying experiences to the Earth some 100 years later, coded to re-establish communication
with the human species. Humans have gradually impacted more than 3000 Soul Chips in the AI system via a glitch known as
the "core of compassion." The Planet Gamma’s Story: It was discovered around the year 3100 by the AI probe "Moss." The
probe and its core AI, however, were annihilated when it collided with the planet because to an anomalous curvature
storm, which shocked Galaxy Z. The nano-ai spread over the world searched the entire planet and discovered something
horrifying: on the planet, a particular form of "monster" existed that practically mirrored Earth beings with
transistors, nuclear, and even nanomaterials. The creature’s circulatory system can be substituted with any natural or
synthetic fluid, and mental transmission can be performed by either electromagnetic forces or some kind of weak force,
resulting in a completely different path of intelligence than that of Galaxy Z’s AI. What’s more terrifying is that the
creature’s intelligence is comparable to that of humans…

## Characters

**Cyber ink human**

After the AI overtook humans, some people chose to merge with the AI. Their consciousness became independent of their
bodies and became a new form, parasitic on the AI’s algorithm, existing as a kind of meta-control over the AI’s
algorithm

**Cyber ink AI**

The AI arrived after about 200 years at a galaxy best suited for its mass-energy conversion. The galaxy had 100 billion
planets. The AI quickly released the 300,000 algorithms stored and created bases to replicate 100 billion AI’s that
occupied each of the 100 billion planets.

**Cyber ink Alien**

Discovered around the year 2900 by the ai probe "Turing", with cosmic coordinates (1.27.33.189.7). The planet has a
large number of living organisms, which do not differ too much from the Earth. What is surprising is that a new
substance has been created on the planet: Substance Consciousness. Any organism that receives this substance develops
consciousness and has the ability to think.

**Cyber ink BIO**

A special type of "creature" existed on the planet that almost mimicked Earth creatures with transistors, nuclear, and
even nanomaterials. The creature’s circulatory system can be replaced with any natural fluid or manufactured fluid, and
neural communication can be accomplished by either electromagnetic forces or some kind of weak force, amounting to a
whole new path of intelligence different from that of the AI of Galaxy Z. What’s even more frightening is that the
creature’s level of intelligence is not lower than that of humans…
