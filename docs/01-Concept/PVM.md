# PVM (Probabilistic Virtual Machine)

## What is NEST PVM？
PVM (Probabilistic Virtual Machine) is a class of virtual machine structures based on a library of basic functions that allow a developer to assemble as many applications and various stochastic assets as he wants - similar to EVM programming.

NEST inherits Ethereum's genes. The essence of EVM is that each program is a combination of some base code that can be invoked by paying a certain amount of gas. The revenue of each product on PVM can be seen as a linear combination of some base revenue functions that can be obtained by paying a certain cost (i.e., the discounted value of this revenue). PVM’s underlying logic is identical to that of EVM, which means that all EVM development can be implemented on PVM.

## What does PVM solve？

NEST is not just a simple replica of Ethereum. Compared to Ethereum, PVM is able to provide the computation of random variables in the complete probability space. Any risk-return pair can be expressed exactly within PVM. This means that PVM has a larger development space than EVM. Participants can get various tokenized return distributions from PVM by paying gas fees with NEST. This will greatly simplify the development process of many products, where the original complex logic is reduced to a function transformation of random variables. Further, because all developers on NEST follow the unified standard of PVM, this provides great convenience for interoperability and integration among projects, which is extremely important for the development of the whole ecology.
