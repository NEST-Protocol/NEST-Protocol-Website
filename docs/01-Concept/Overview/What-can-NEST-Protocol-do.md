# What can NEST Protocol do？

NEST Protocol can be simplified to a production and programming system for stochastic assets. This not only solves the derivatives settlement problem that ETH cannot accomplish but also dramatically simplifies the development process of Defi and Gamefi. It also avoids the problem of running a new unit of value while developing a project, allowing developers to focus on application development rather than token liquidity operations.

Because NEST is the new risk-trading archetype, it does not need to be hedged like traditional financial assets. It is therefore perfect for providing large amounts of liquidity. Below we shall discuss how this can be applied to different scenarios:

## Derivatives

Futures and options are the most direct beneficiaries of the NEST system. Because the contract is the only seller, there un- derlying derivatives need the demand parameters and corresponding expected values to be provided before they can be sold. For example, if someone needs a call option based on ETH/USDT, the strike price and strike date need to be entered to get the cost calculable, and the option can be exercised at expiration according to the conditions set.

## Parallel Asset/ Stablecoins

Based on the price system, parallel as- sets representing arbitrary price information flow can be generated, and their earning are the same as the original assets. For example, PBTC, PUSD, PETH, etc., the flow of price information generated in this way can be duplicated by collateralizing the NEST or the assets accepted by the system, or it can be produced based on the conver- gence algorithm (supported by the system’s interest rate oracle), but the cost paid must be guaranteed to match the generated assets.

## Bond and interest rate oracle

The system can create an endogenous bond reflecting the overall supply and demand to reflect the time value of NEST, which can also be understood as an interest rate oracle, a system-level variable.

## Borrowing and lending

In the case of parallel assets, borrowing and lending become very simple, and liquidity is suﬀicient, provided, of course, that the overall convergence property of the system, the interest rate of borrowing and lending, needs to be discounted against the price information flow, and can reflect the future price changes and changes in the interest rate oracle.

## Dabs

An asset-backed bond based on NEST or ETH WBTC, backed by a NEST contract that guarantees the payment of the bond and whose interest rate can be maintained based on an interest rate oracle.

## Dex

Based on the NEST oracle and parallel asset/price coins, trading becomes more accessible and feasible with no liquidity barriers.

## Probability coin

An underlying stochastic asset that reflects a variety of distributions.

## Game item composition

Any Game item composition is a swap of economic relationships, so it is only necessary to call the PVM function to correspond the item to an NFT and their composition relationships.

## Gamefi cross-platform interoperability

When different platforms are developed with NEST, they have the same system algorithm for clear- ing and billing tokens. This is the benefit of One NEST and One Coin: This creative model can be highly convenient for Gamefi platforms to call NEST functions interchangeably in the NEST protocol, as long as NEST constraints are met.

## Putable NFT

A NEST-linked NFT structure that can set a floor price according to a given algorithm and be interconnected as a whole to trade with the system after certain constraints are met.
