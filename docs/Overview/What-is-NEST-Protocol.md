# What is NEST Protocl?
**NEST Protocol is the stochastic computer based on PVM, enables the generation and programming of stochastic assets. **

NEST Protocol creatively introduces random information flow with a truely decentralized oracle, NEST Oracle.
And it tokenizes random information flow through the OMM() mechanism, generating many stochastic assets. 
PVM(probabilistic virtual machine) , based on basic functions, can program stochastic assets, which applies to a large number of real-world scenarios.
An inherent cost mechanism ensures the system supply converges, resulting in a new universal coin with an innate price appreciation logic.
The NEST coin provides a whole new development tool and is a creative new asset for the blockchain world.
